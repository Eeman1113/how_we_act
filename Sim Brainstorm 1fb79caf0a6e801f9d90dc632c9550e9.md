# Sim Brainstorm

**Okayy, So the Big Idea... (Overall Vision)**

Right, so what I'm thinking is this: I want to build a cool, interactive simulation. Like a little mini-town, but with AI agents ‚Äì let's say five of them to start. These guys should act kinda human, you know? Have their own routines, jobs, maybe even get into little dramas. The core of it will be this fancy "cognitive architecture" thing I've been reading about. And the main goal? To see what weird social stuff emerges and how smart these agents can be in this little world I'm building. Oh, and they'll talk using only two emojis! That'll be their "brain" language, sort of. I'm planning to let this run for, hmmm, maybe 100 game days? And I'll log *everything* ‚Äì every action, every emoji "thought" ‚Äì for later.

## **Part 1: The World and Who Lives In It**

**1. The Map ‚Äì Gotta Have a Place! (The Environment: A Visual Foundation)**

So, the town itself. I've got this hand-drawn map (the one Viju sketched out). That's gonna be the blueprint. It's got all the key spots:

![IMG_8222.jpeg](Sim%20Brainstorm%201fb79caf0a6e801f9d90dc632c9550e9/IMG_8222.jpeg)

- **Agent Hangouts & Workspots:**
    - The Handyman needs a "Workshop" and a "Resource Shop" next to it.
    - Toolsmith gets a "Workshop" and their own "Shop" too.
    - Doctor's gotta have a "Clinic" and a "Medicine Garden" for supplies.
    - Mayor needs a proper "Mayor's Building."
    - And the Farmer, well, they get a main building, a "Granary," a few "Crop" fields, and some "Crop Processing" areas.
- **Town Center & Shops:**
    - A big "Common Space" in the middle, that's essential.
    - And yeah, a few other "Shops" ‚Äì maybe the Toolsmith and Handyman have storefronts, and something near the Farmer's area for produce?
- **Nature & Utilities:**
    - Definitely need "River Access" and a "River" along one side.
    - And a "Garbage Processing" spot ‚Äì gotta be realistic! Maybe split it into "Non-Bio" and "Bio."

This map feels right. It's custom, it's got everything the agents need to do their thing.

**2. The Crew ‚Äì My AI Peeps (The Populace: A Micro-Society of AI Agents)**

Okayy, so five agents. Each with a job, like a real little town:

- **The Handyman:** Fixes stuff. Broken fences, leaky roofs (if I get that detailed!), general town upkeep.
- **The Toolsmith:** Makes the tools. Handyman will need 'em, Farmer too. Maybe others.
- **The Doctor:** Heals 'em when they get "sick." Adds a bit of challenge.
- **The Mayor:** The boss, kinda. Maybe they kick off town events or deal with big issues.
- **The Farmer:** Grows the food. Super important. Manages the fields and all that.

**3. How They'll Act ‚Äì Makin' 'Em Real-ish (Agent Behavior: Simulating Human-like Life)**

So, these agents, they need to feel alive, right? Not just robots. So they'll:

- **Do Daily Stuff:** Wake up, "clean up" (whatever that means for an AI), "brush" (metaphorically!), go to work.
- **Have Ups and Downs:** Get "sick," for example. Then they'd need the Doctor.
- **Be Social (Kinda):** Maybe they can "hold a party"? And definitely interact with each other.
- **Have Needs & Wants:** Basic stuff like hunger (maybe tied to Farmer's food), rest, and even social connection. Their jobs will give them goals too.

**4. How They "Talk" ‚Äì The Emoji Brain! (Communication Protocol: The Emoji "Brain")**

This is the fun part. They're gonna "talk" using only **two emojis**. That's it. It's like their little AI brain's way of outputting complex ideas. So, like, if the Farmer needs help with crops, maybe they show [üå±,‚ùì] to the Handyman. It's a constraint, but it could lead to interesting stuff.

**5. Lettin' It Run & Watchin' What Happens (Simulation Parameters: Observation and Data Collection)**

I'm gonna let this whole thing run for **100 game days**. And I mean, log *everything*. Every move, every emoji they send, every time their "state" changes (like getting sick). All that data will be gold for seeing what patterns pop up, if the emoji thing works, and just how the town evolves.

## **Part 2: The Brains of the Operation ‚Äì Agent Architecture**

Okayy, so that "Generative Agents" paper had some really smart ideas about making AI agents believable. I'm gonna borrow heavily from their architecture.

**1. Memory ‚Äì They Gotta Remember Stuff! (Memory Stream & Retrieval)**

- **What it is:** Basically, a big ol' database for each agent, full of their experiences. Even though they "talk" in emojis, their memories will be in natural language ‚Äì like a diary. Each memory entry will have the details, when it happened, and when they last "thought" about it. "Observations" are the simplest kind of memory.
- **How I'll Build It:**
    - Each agent gets its own list or database for memories.
    - **Types of Memories:**
        - **Observations:** Just stuff they see or experience. Like, "Saw Farmer at the well at 08:00 Day 10," or "Handyman went to workshop at 14:30 Day 10," or even "Got emojis [üõ†Ô∏è, üëç] from Toolsmith at 12:00 Day 10 (my brain thinks this means: Toolsmith says tools are done and they're good)."
        - **Reflections:** These are deeper thoughts. Like the AI making connections: "Hmm, the Handyman visits the Toolsmith most afternoons. Maybe they're working together on something?"
        - **Plans:** What they intend to do. "Day 11 Plan: 1. Go to farm. 2. Look at water pump. 3. Tell Mayor what's up."
    - **What's in a Memory Entry:**
        - `description`: The actual text of the memory.
        - `timestamp`: Game day and time.
        - `type`: Is it an Observation, Reflection, Plan, or a Communication?
        - `importance_score`: How big a deal is this memory? Scale of 1-10. I can get `ollama` to rate this: "Hey ollama, how poignant is this memory: '[memory text]'? 1 for meh, 10 for super important."
        - `related_agents`: (Optional) Who else was involved?
- **Gettin' the Right Memories (Retrieval):** When an agent needs to decide something, it can't look at *all* its memories. That'd be too much. The paper suggests a smart way:
    - **Recency:** Stuff that just happened is probably more relevant.
    - **Importance:** Those high-score memories should pop up more.
    - **Relevance:** If I'm thinking about the Farmer, memories *about* the Farmer are key. Could be simple keyword stuff or checking `related_agents`.
    Then, I'll grab the top few memories and feed them to `ollama` to help it make a good decision.

**2. Thinkin' Deep ‚Äì Reflections (Reflection)**

- **What it is:** This is where agents get a bit smarter. They look back at their memories and try to figure out bigger picture stuff. Generalize, make inferences. And these reflections? They go right back into the memory stream, so they can use 'em later.
- **How I'll Build It:**
    - This won't happen all the time. Maybe at the end of each game day, or if a bunch of important stuff happens.
    - I'll prompt `ollama`: "Okayy `ollama`, this is [Agent Name]. Here's some recent important stuff they saw: [list of observations]. What are, like, 2 or 3 big takeaways or reflections about what's been going on with them, other agents, or the town?"
    - And bam, those reflections get saved as new memories.

**3. Makin' Plans & Doin' Stuff (Planning & Reacting)**

- **What it is:** This is how agents turn their "thoughts" (memories, reflections) and what's happening *right now* into actual plans and actions. Keeps them from just doing random stuff.
- **How I'll Build It:**
    - **Daily Game Plan:** Every morning (in game time), `ollama` helps each agent make a rough plan for the day. The prompt would be something like: "It's [Game Day/Time]. You're [Agent Name], the [Agent Role]. You're generally like [Agent Description]. Recently you've been thinking [Key Reflections]. Your main goals are [List of Goals, e.g., Farmer wants to grow food, sell it]. Sketch out a plan with 3-5 main things to do today." This plan gets saved as a memory.
    - **Breaking It Down (Maybe Simpler for Emojis):** The paper talks about making super detailed plans. For my 2-emoji system, maybe the plans stay a bit more high-level. Like, an action in the plan could just be "go to [place]" or "try to 'say' [thing I want to say] to [other agent]."
    - **Whoa, Something Happened! (Reacting):** Agents are always "seeing" what's up. If something big happens ‚Äì another agent "talks" to them, they suddenly feel "sick," or the environment changes unexpectedly ‚Äì they need to react. I'll ask `ollama`: "[Agent Name]'s current plan is [current step]. But then this happened: [new observation]. Should they react? If so, what should they do, and does their plan need to change?"
    - Then, whatever action they decide on (from their plan or a reaction) turns into them moving in `pygame` or sending out their two emojis.

## **Part 3: How I'm Gonna Build This Thing (High-Level Implementation Approach)**

Okayy, the tech side. I'm thinking:

- **The Visuals & World:** `pygame` seems like the way to go. I can draw the map, make little sprites for the agents, and show them moving around.
- **The Agent Brains:** `ollama` is key here. It'll connect to my local LLMs. Those LLMs are gonna be the "brains" doing the heavy lifting for memory stuff, reflecting, planning, and figuring out the emoji communications.
- **The Glue & Guts:** Python for everything else. Writing the agent classes, the main simulation loop, managing all those memories, talking to `ollama`, and making `pygame` do its thing.

## **Part 4: What I Hope to See & Learn (Key Objectives & Expected Outcomes)**

So, what's the point of all this? I'm hoping to:

- Actually build a working town sim with these five AI dudes, all powered by LLMs using that cool architecture.
- Get that 2-emoji communication system working and see if it's any good, or just confusing.
- Watch for 100 game days and log all the crazy stuff that happens ‚Äì emergent behaviors, who becomes "friends," all that.
- Dig through all that logged data to figure out *how* they're planning, reflecting, and changing based on what happens.
- And, ultimately, see if these agents actually seem believable and not just random.

The dream outcome? A pile of data and some cool observations that teach me more about making AI agents that feel a bit more real in these kinds of simulated worlds.
